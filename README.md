				Introduction - Django Web Development with Python by sendtdex
				
Basic Idea :
	There is a project called 'IVMNM'
		consist of apps : login and dasboard.
		
	At the beginning, we will execute 'django-admin startproject <project_name>' . In this case 'django-admin startproject IVMNM' and folder IVMNM appears.
	Next, we want to build our apps.
		'django-admin startapp login' -> folder login is created.
		'django-admin startapp dashboard' -> folder dashboard is created.
				
WHY DJANGO?
	Because it is python, native ubuntu interpreter
	Then, why not PHP ? 
		Using Codeigniter ? People say it is outdated 	;(
		Using Laravel ? I don't know how to use it 		;(
